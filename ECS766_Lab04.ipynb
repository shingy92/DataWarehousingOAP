However, please note that questions which explicitly require loading CSV files or using a pre-loaded dataset must be addressed using code. A few assignment questions throughout the module might be easier to complete by hand, although could also be addressed using code. In both cases, either responding to questions manually or using code, please **do make sure to show your work** - i.e., how you derived the result, by showing the code that was used to generate the result that addresses the question and/or by writing down your reasoning or math derivations.\n",
